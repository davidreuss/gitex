DESCRIPTION
-----------
gitex is an attempt to create interoperability between git and cvs

Its purpose is importing a project from CVS into a git repository,
you can clone and work on. After commiting your changes you can export
those back with the same tool, by running gitex with the export option.

DEPENDENCIES
------------
cvsps, and git

INSTALL
-------
1. Copy script bin/gitex to somewhere in your $PATH

2. Set the following variables in your global git config

# Where gitex will live and all imported/exported repos as well
git config --global gitex.home $gitex_home

# What shared group will your repositories be writable by?
git config --global gitex.group $gitex_group

# The CVS root of your cvs repsoitories - defaults to $CVSROOT
git config --global gitex.cvsroot $gitex_cvsroot

# At every export gitex will tag your commit by this name
# Makes it easy to find out what was last exported
git config --global gitex.lastexporttag $gitex_lastexporttag

# There's a 5th config variable that you can set on a *per project* basis, if you
# need to export to a different branch than HEAD (in CVS!).

# In the repository where you have other branch than HEAD you normally export to
git config gitex.exportbranch $gitex_exportbranch

3. PROFIT!
